5,965226,"<NAME/>,I am interested in speaking with you further concerning investment opportunities.     Although you mentioned that  the $1,800  (the amount in my account) is a small sum,  I have been reluctant to invest more money with your firm,   given to performance of the suggestions provided previously.   I have been a market maker in the electricity business and I realize that no one is right all of the time;    I dont expect this.      However,   I do expect some consistent contact from a broker  who has been successful in his own trading, not just success in brokering trades.      My view will be that the more success we have,  the more money I will be willing to invest.I am interested in discussing my specific financial situation with you  and learning more about you, your track record and your abilities.I do wish to talk about covered calls on specific options that I have expiring in January.    I would also like to discuss any other profitable ideas that fit my profile.I will not use your suggestions to trade at  discount brokerage or otherwise abuse our potential relationship.   I look forward to hearing from you."

60,322227,"You have always been on the move seeking affectionate, satisfying and harmonious relationships. Your ultimate goal has been the realisation of an intimate union in which there could be love, self-sacrifice and mutual trust. It has often been said that ""True love is just around the corner""...and maybe... if you haven't found it as yet - you possibly soon will. In the past there have been .. and maybe there still are many things that you have had to do without. You have now decided to set your sights on a position or situation that could give you greater prestige and which will afford you considerable self esteem.You wear your heart on your sleeve ... and since you are an emotional person you are apt to give your all ... heart and soul ... to all those that show you a little affection ... but take care... it would appear that you have been extremely hurt in the past...and you keep leaving yourself wide open for punishment..Whatever you strive to do, something always seems to be holding you back. There is no subterfuge in you. You are a clear thinker and all you demand from life, in a relationship, is a partner whom you can trust and with whom you can, together, develop a foundation of trust based on understanding. You are your own person... and you demand freedom of thought ...to follow your own convictions. You have no interest in ""two-timing"" and all you seek is sincerity and ""straight-dealing"". You wish to be left in peace... no more conflict and no more differences of opinion ... In fact you just don't want to be involved in any arguments of any shape or form ... All you want is for ""them"" to get on with it - and to leave you alone.."

220,997109,"<NAME/> and Dari, here is my answer.  Are you comfortable with it	before I send it to the shipper.  Thanks. <NAME/>	Answer:  If an interruptible shipper is bumped in the Intraday 1	         cycle, the shipper will keep 1/3 of their scheduled volumes.	         Shippers schedule becomes their actual unless they are the		   operator of the point.  Therefore, they would not encounter	         a DDVC penalty.  If the Shipper is the operator, NNG looks at		   total scheduled volumes vs total actual delivered volumes and determines		   if a DDVC is appropriate.  The DDVC is based on the difference		   between total scheduled and the actual delivery at the point.  	If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.	<NAME/> Blair (713-853-7637)."

They respect me and know that it's not a choice.  It was just so weird, because I did not have any agenda or intention on telling them that at that point, we were just talking about stuff (and drinking) and I just told them.  And I told them, you can't be totally surprised by this - and they said no.  They had questioned it before, but had not wanted to offend me by asking.  At the same time, they were holding out hope that it wasn't true.  But now they know.  They didn't really have alot of questions or anything, but were just accepting of it.

227,997109,"<NAME/> and <NAME/>, I met with <NAME/> Berger, Terry Kowalke and Raetta Zadow this morning	to review yesterday's meeting on the concerns for DDVC's at ""small customer delivery points""	on the southend of NNG's system. Through our discussions, here are a few ideas including some	of yesterday's discussion.  These ideas may be somewhat out of the norm, but we thought we	would at least  throw them on the table.	1.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should agree with us to lift the requirement	     that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the Bushton Universe.  It can still be	     required in the ""Bushton Universe"", just not as restrictive as it is today.	2.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should allow us to do storage true ups	     at 8:00 a.m. at the end of the gas day to eliminate DDVC.	3.  If these deliveries are on Firm contracts, can we sell them SMS to cover these small volumes	     even though they are in the field area?	4.  Richfield Storage point - (I am not sure it is even active)  -  Could we get Oneok to agree to 	     allow true ups if we are supplying the true up with gas coming from the Richfield storage point?	     I am sure this alternative would need to include the storage group.	We would be glad to participate in any future discussions.  Thanks. <NAME/>"

That last email from Devil-Pooch made meyearn for the sight of his blood soiling the field of battle.The key to <NAME/>'s wins (and I have given it some thought):1) Quick advancement. He doesn't attack early, I believe it is to build stone walls,	encompassing a larger area than is proportional for his team. And to seal us off.2) Large level of resources, enabling him to cue Paladins to build as his army is killed.	Thus he has a constant wave of attacks. He also builds resources until the pointhe decides to attack, then he kills all but maybe 20 villagers. His army is concentrated and huge.3) Build castles on conquered territory.If we wall a large area, build resource levels quickly, then attack as soon as we each have a40 man army, with additional soldiers cued. we will win. The use of trebuchets is imperative.We should have a total of 10 on our team. Towers kill.AND WE MUST NEVER SIT BACK AND LET HIM REBUILD. Whenever we hang out not attacking,it's over.J"

We have asked them whether they mean OOME when we run.    To a man,   the Ercot dispatch guys have said that OOMC means to run, they want the power.     I have launched three e-mails (requesting clarification)  to <NAME/> Patterson,  starting weeks ago on this issue.    Yesterday,   I caught <NAME/> by phone at 5:30pm.<NAME/> consulted with his operations group and determined that we had been OOMC'd and we should run,  but they are not going to pay us the hr calc.They said that OOMC means run and we are supposed to sell this power.     This confusion on our part will prove costly to Frontera as they will be paid the imbalance, instead of the heat rate calc.       We cannot sell in the offpeak hours for greater than $5.      It costs us $26 to generate power.<NAME/> said "" dont worry, at worst case you can file for reimbursement.""     <NAME/> also said that we will get paid for the capacity. But what???It is my opinion that it is no accident that Ercot was vague on this issue.     They want to penalize us if we dont run,  and if we do ,  we will lose money.We then file to get a break-even rebate.  They are acquiring ancillary reserves for free and not even paying for the energy component.I realize that these issues will be discussed in the Tuesday meeting and I will provide examples, as requested by Ercot.I need some support from the protocols and I need some suggestions.   I  do not want to allow these guys to game us anymore.  We will be more vocal in this meeting.

305,543719,"Group,Here is the most current information regarding charges from the CAISO, the FERC Ruling and the Price Cap.1.  The current price cap is $91.87.  We should continue our practice of not selling over the cap, however we can (and should) buy over the cap if necessary for the system reliability of our service customers.2.  The FERC order specifies a penalty of $100 per mw for underscheduling load (greater than 5% per load zone underscheduled).  Despite the CAISO's repeated protests (and the IOU's complete disregard of this order), WE can expect to be subject to this penalty.3.  When a WARNING is in effect the CAISO will be making out-of -market calls.  These OOM calls will not show up in the expost or beep stack.  Therefore when power supplies become tight, the prices in the ""expost"" may actually drop.  We should continue our practice of NOT leaving uninstructed energy in the CAISO whenever possible.4.  We should continue to participate in the CAISO congestion market.  The CAISO frequently has unexpected hourly path loadings, and congestion has occurred in the hour ahead market that was not present in the day ahead market.5.  Remember to include CAISO export fees, Tie Meter Multipliers/import fees and grid management fees in your CAISO calculations of wheeling charges.We will have a real-time meeting on Monday July 9th at 4:30 PM in Mt. Hood.  We will discuss other changes in the market at that time.  Please make plans to attend.Thank you,<NAME/>"

340,x6114104622172211485,"http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/11/05/gen.attack.on.terror/index.htmlCNN) -- Seven airport security workers have been suspended after police said a man made it through a security checkpoint at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport with knives, a can of Mace and a stun gun. Security screeners took two knives from Subash Gurung, 27, after he initially went through the checkpoint Saturday night, authorities said. Gurung then was allowed to pass through. Seven more knives, Mace and a stun gun were found in his carry-on luggage during a random search before boarding a United Airlines flight, police said. The suspect, who told authorities he is from Nepal, was arrested Sunday night by the FBI and will be arraigned Monday on a federal charge of unlawfully taking a weapon aboard an aircraft. He originally had been arrested Saturday by local police, charged with two misdemeanors and released on bond. CNN has learned of a possible connection between Gurung and a man who is being held as a material witness in the September 11 terrorist attacks. Gurung listed the same West Hollywood Avenue address in Chicago as the detainee. (Full story </2001/US/11/05/inv.ohare.security.breach/index.html>) In the U.S.-led retaliation for the terror attacks, Taliban forces were leaving their southern Afghan stronghold of Kandahar on Monday as U.S.-led airstrikes intensified. After a quiet day Sunday -- allied planes dropped a single bomb southeast of the city -- CNN's Kamal Hyder reported heavy bombardment of rural districts around Kandahar as well as military targets to the northeast, southeast and west. There were reports of further attacks overnight on the Kajaki Dam area, where a hydroelectric plant is located that provides power to Kandahar. Taliban frontline positions north of Kabul also were hit Monday, and there were reports of intense fighting near the strategic northern city of Mazar-e Sharif."

405,543719,"Enpower Preschedule Workspace and Path ConfirmationPlease note we have two new Enpower applications currently in use by the Prescheduling Group that are also available for Real Time use. A manual has been placed in your inbox describing the process in detail. You will be using this in place of Lotus Notes to confirm and process cut power schedules going forward. You must check out with all major marketers and utilities each night. This would include but not be limited to: AEP, AES-New Energy, Aquila, Avista, Calpine, Constellation, Coral, <NAME/>, Dynegy, El Paso Merchant, Exelon, Meico, Mirant, Morgan, NCPA, Reliant, PPLMontana, PowerX, Sempra, SMUD, TransAlta, <NAME/>, and southwest utilities such as Pinnacle West, SRP, PNM, PSCO and Pacificorp. Northwest counterparties are checked out by BPA and do not need to be checked again by us (this would include SCL, TCL, PSPL, BPAP, GCPUD, EWEB, IPC, MPC, SNPD, WWP). These checkouts should be started in HE 19 and finished by HE 21. NOTE: You must open both PSW and Path Confirmation from your local Enpower Launchpad, which can be found under the Start Menu in Programs/Business Applications/Enpower/Enpower Login. Following are a few pointers to help you get started. 1.	All prescheduled power paths will be loaded into Path Confirmation. This application must be opened from local Enpower and can be found in the menu that drops down from the hand icon at the left under ""Tools.""2.	A box will appear asking you to select a default trading desk. Choose ""West"" and click ""Okay.""3.	Supply schedules are shown in gray, transmission in yellow, and market in blue.4.	Sort paths by clicking and dragging on the heading you'd like to sort by. Suggestion: Sort by counterparty while making confirmation calls. When all schedules with that counterparty are confirmed, highlight each schedule5.	Highlight the path you'd like to confirm or cut by clicking in the thin box to the very left of the Path Confirmation screen. Highlight multiple rows by holding the ""Control"" button and while selecting multiple rows.6.	Confirm a path by highlighting and clicking the telephone icon. A screen will come up requesting contact information from the appropriate counterparty. Because this information saves directly to Enpower, save time runs about a minute.7.	Cut a path by highlighting and clicking the scissors icon. A screen called ""Cut Information"" will come up. Select the ""New Path Cut"" icon in the upper left-hand corner and supply the relevant information (region, cut time, resupply path, Enpower numbers, Turret ID, etc.)8.	Double click anywhere in a particular row to see a detail of that schedule. This screen will show the terms and hours of the deal as well as volume, price, Enpower deal and OATI tag number.Lotus Notes is being phased out of operation, and we are working with the Enpower team in <NAME/> to develop a discussion database similar to the one we currently use in Notes. These new applications will be a part of that, so please begin adjusting your nightly schedule checkout and/or cuts procedure accordingly (i.e. Record cut paths in Enpower Path Confirmation, not Lotus Notes.)"

Also, the commodities prices in gas and crude and fuel oil have come off quite a bit, which makes the general investors worry about the future earnings potential of the companies.  They are locked into contracts at a very good price, so whether the price of the commodity goes up or down they still make their cash flow targets.  Remember, the CEO of the company has a stack of over 25% of the company, so he is very tied to the overall stock price.

Try to have the counterparties continue any paths around us. Just ""bow out"" gracefully if you have no other options with the words ""L - D's.""4.)

For example, EPE will be cutting all schedules going into California on light load (100 mws). If we cannot resupply the schedules we need to tell the state that we are underscheduling our load by 100 mws. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. We have posted an LC with Cali for this reason.Also, EPE will be long RT 100 mws off-peak as they are no longer selling to us. 25 mws should be sold to TEP to cover a forward schedule.

508,x8464695915,"Hi <NAME/>,Just a note to recap our recent and ongoing discussions regarding the disposition of the Heartland Steel and CSN agreements:At this point, <NAME/>'s Legal Department has requested documentation from CSN that substantiates the fact that CSN did purchase Heartland Steel.  I have contacted your legal counsel, Mr. Tarter, and obtained information that will hopefully satisfy <NAME/>'s request.  The next step for me is to meet with my legal staff on Monday, October 15, 2001 to determine the following:1) Is the relationship between Heartland Steel and <NAME/> completely severed?2) Do we come up with a brand new pricing and deal structure with CSN, or does the existing structure with Heartland Steel remain in place?Once, these determinations have been made, we'll follow up with the necessary legal documents.I'm hoping to have resolution to these entire process by early next week.Talk to you then.P.S. As a notional indicator, November, 2001 pricing for Chicago city gate delivered volume (which is comparable to your location) would be estimated at NYMEX (currently $2.41) plus approximately $0.10.Please keep in mind that the NYMEX price changes on a second-by-second basis, and this will impact your price."

We went to the dreaded ""Chuckee Cheese"" this weekend and oh boy, was I ever glad to get out of there.  After that, we went  to the Galleria, because when I was there before without them, I saw a shoe store that had really cute, fashionable shoes for little boys.  What I didn't realize was that they were designer shoes.  Who ever heard of <NAME/> <NAME/> shoes for little boys.  $65 a pair for the kind that I liked.  But since I was there, I said, what the heck?  After about 20 minutes, we had been waited on, but still neither one of my boys had even tried on a pair of shoes yet, let alone buying a pair (the sales folks were truly taking their sweet time).  I was pissed and me and my possee (Jordan and Kendall) almost ""set if off"" at the Galleria.  We just left after I told them that their service was unacceptable.

This turned out to be a ""Canadian"" firm purchase on the part of Enmax. Please do not fill any sale to EnMax with MPC energy. We need to treat EnMax just like ECC. We should buy an option or a call and then exercise that option. MPC does not have this capability and should not be used in this manner.Finally, the NW evening peak has arrived.

532,887850,"yeah,  the Offense was very unhuskerlike, except for Crouch, He had 150 yards passing which was fairly good.  The line was not ready for such an aggressive D this early.  I do think TCU has a great Defense as evidenced by their #1 Defense ranking last year. Evidently they had some depth as well becasue they lost half of their starters to Graduation/NFL.  The bright spot was the Defense giving up only 165 yards of TOTal yards.  their only score came on a broken play that went for 67yards.  We were also lucky that Casey Printers pulled a muscle on that play.  We played 2 true freshman alot on the D and they were very good.  The D should be faster and more aggressive than last year.  The Domers think they have a chance now that we only scored 21 on TCU.  I say TCU is better than people think, but I'm glad we didn't open with NotreDame.  I got your pictures.

I exercised when it was 1.0 up....i really felt that this was more a peak for now than a trend up.Also, the move yesterday I feel was influenced by news that we were selling our <NAME/> power plant....this is the 2nd news story related to enron selling assets (Portland General) and reducing workforce (<NAME/> Europe laying off employees).  Yesterday there was an article that was released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the <NAME/> deal to go through....hence...me feeling like this thing was probably going to move back down.Also, the employee survey results I read.....not good...enron employee ""consumer"" confidence is not good.  Not to mention the fact that I see many of my peers getting solicited w/ big bucks to work elsewhere and the volatile trading environment (hence $$$$$ for enron) slowly dissapating.Lastly....I can always buy enron stock .....at these price levels...taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank..is probably easy money....I can always take the money market and get back in enron....sure I am forgoing getting in at 28.5 (the strike price) but the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40....is a few thousand dollars....rather forgo that and get back in on a definite uptrend...then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show.OH...lastly..I am still in EOG which will move in sympathy w/ ENE if that market continues to trend up.So there you go....the most detailed trade report i think i've ever written.Talk to you later hunL-me"

First, for deal #549162, this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp.  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit.  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?  Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool. Second, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.  The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753). Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices. The deal is now at $320 and $300.

578,965226,"<NAME/>,I have a business question,  for a change.   Ercot load is forecast to be as high as 46,124 for hour ending 1200 today.   The actual printed from the website is less than 43,000.   I know that there is South to North congestion,   but is this actual load right?    Is interruptible load being curtailed due to the congestion or is their rain somewhere that isnt showing on our weathermap?Any help you can give would be appreciated.   I dont think that this is proprietary info or anything.    I am trying to see if the forecast is worthless.Thanks,JMF"

( I know I act tought when it comes to this stuff but I am really sad about this one)  I guess that I am not sick and I do have lots of friends.  But I am tired and need someone to take over at this point - - - - I can't believe that you didn't get my email about gas being a buy a couple of weeks ago.  I guess if I had seen you when I was there, I could have told you in person.  AS for business over here, gas and power trading is still going strong.  However, all of the events have affected us in a huge way financially.  Down to whether we get bonuses or not.  It is not going to be a good year just trying to stay strong but I think that we will survive, and mostly thanks to EnronOnline.Curious about what's going on there since you mentioned it.  Anyway - sorry to burden you with my personal problems.  I do hope things are going ok for you - too bad you're not going to make it here.  As we are in a cash crunch, I think I am probobly grounded for the remainder of the year.  Who knows!Keep in touch -K."
